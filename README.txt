## Project Introduction
In this Regression Machine Learning Project, we will be analysing the used car dataset taken from  a website www.cardekho.com, consisting of features like car name, manufacturing year, kms driven, ownership, torque, fuel type etc. Our focus will be on analysing the data, getting the insights related to these features and there role in affecting the sales price, we will perform feature engineering, feature selection and develop a Regression model that will predict the sales price based on the new test data.
